AndroidDrawer
=============

A simple but powerful menu drawer implementation. A lot of functionally are based on very [good article][1] by [Cyril Mottier][2] and Facebook mobile application.

You don't need to extend yet another Activity implementation, this simplify integration with bigger applications.

Usage
-

Creating drawer object, second parameter is layout we want to inject into drawer

```java
mDrawer = new Drawer(this, R.layout.drawer_content, getWindow(), 100, 300);
```

Opening drawer

```java
drawer.show();
```

By default, each time drawer is opened its content is created and disposed when closed, this behaviour can be changed by setting reuse flag

```java
mDrawer.setReuse(true);
```

Drawer can have different animations while opening and closing

```java
mDrawer.setFadeDrawer(true); // this will fade in/out content of drawer
mDrawer.setMoveDrawer(true); // this will create parallax effect
mDrawer.setScaleDrawer(true); // this will create effect of coming content from background
mDrawer.setTransform3dDrawer(true); // this will apply 3d transformation
```
Two last options are very similar to default ICS Launcher effects

Bezel Swipe
-

AndroidDrawer library also provides ability to open drawer by swiping finger from bezel.
To use that functionality override dispatchTouchEvent method in your Activity

```java
@Override
public boolean dispatchTouchEvent(MotionEvent ev)
{
	if (mBezelSwipe == null)
	{
		int dp48 = Math.round(TypedValue.applyDimension(TypedValue.COMPLEX_UNIT_DIP, 48, getResources().getDisplayMetrics()));
		mBezelSwipe = new BezelSwipe(mDrawer, getWindow(), getSupportActionBar().getHeight(), dp48);
	}

	BezelSwipe.DispatchState returnType = mBezelSwipe.dispatchTouchEvent(ev);
	switch (returnType)
	{
		case RETURN_TRUE:
		{
			return true;
		}
		case RETURN_FALSE:
		{
			return false;
		}
		case FAKE_CANCEL:
		{
			ev.setAction(MotionEvent.ACTION_CANCEL);
			return super.dispatchTouchEvent(ev);
		}
		case CALL_SUPER:
		default:
		{
			return super.dispatchTouchEvent(ev);
		}
	}
}
```
